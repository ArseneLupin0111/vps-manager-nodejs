# FlexServer Dashboard Design System

The dashboard follows `VPS Management Dashboard/src`: a compact dark operational console with lime command accents and square panels.

## Tokens

`packages/web/src/index.css` defines three token layers: `--palette-*` primitive HSL channels, semantic surface/status aliases, and `--fleet-*` / `--telemetry-*` component aliases. Tailwind exposes `ink`, `panel`, `raised`, `line`, `dim`, `text`, `signal`, `warn`, `crit`, and `info`; shadcn semantic tokens map to this palette. Use tokens rather than component-local color literals.

- `ink`: page background and inputs; `panel`: cards and dialogs.
- `raised`: secondary and hover surfaces; `line`: borders and separators.
- `text`: primary text; `dim`: secondary text.
- `signal`: lime commands, healthy states, active tabs.
- `warn`, `crit`, `info`: amber warning, red failure, blue information.

## Layout and typography

- Fleet sidebar: 272px desktop host navigation, active host indicator, health count, CPU/RAM snapshots, and create action. Below `lg`, hosts become a horizontally scrollable rail.
- Fleet page: operational summaries, search/status filters, card/table switch, two-column cards collapsing to one on narrow screens. Search filters the page results, not the persistent host navigation.
- Workspace: server identity and seven horizontal section links; compact host/container/job summaries, failure notice, three resource gauges, two telemetry panels, recent audit and jobs, then static system facts.
- Flat square surfaces, no decorative gradients or panel shadows.
- Body text is compact; `.tnum` provides monospace tabular numerals for telemetry and identifiers.
- Progress bars are thin. Status pills retain text labels, not color alone.
- Secondary text uses the shared `dim` token at 68% lightness. Capacity labels use explicit binary units (KiB/MiB/GiB/TiB), consistent across host and Docker byte counts.
- Overview audit rows prioritize time/actor and event/outcome; redundant server and opaque identifiers stay in the details drawer. Compact job panels size to content rather than stretching to match audit height.

## Data and interaction

Retain existing API-backed actions, dialogs, authentication, capability restrictions, and terminal lifecycle. Missing telemetry must be labeled unavailable; charts must not relabel CPU history as memory or network history. Docker monitoring remains a separate workspace tab.

Keep keyboard focus visible and dialogs dismissible. Tables may scroll within their containers on narrow screens. Pulse indicators respect reduced motion; existing overlay transitions remain in the shared primitives.

- Host health is independent of job outcomes and container counts. Recent failed jobs produce a notice linking to Jobs; non-running containers have a neutral count and Docker link, not an inferred failure. Stale Docker counts retain an explicit snapshot label.
- Failed jobs display the percentage reached, reported failure reason and finish time when available. Progress bars appear only while jobs are running; absent worker/duration metadata is omitted. Existing log links remain available.

### Public landing and access

The English landing at `/` uses its own dark navy/blue marketing palette scoped to `.landing-page` in `landing.css` (`--l-bg`, `--l-panel`, `--l-raised`, `--l-line`, `--l-line-soft`, `--l-text`, `--l-dim`, `--l-blue`, `--l-ok`, `--l-warn`, `--l-violet`, plus re-hued `--telemetry-cpu`/`--telemetry-memory`), overriding the dashboard's charcoal/lime tokens without touching them. It uses 16–20px reading text, 72–112px desktop section spacing and 48–72px mobile spacing. Keep a centered hero with a large regular-weight single-line title ("Modern VPS Management"), a concise lead, docs-primary/GitHub-secondary actions, a compact capability row, then a wide centered static, labeled English preview (server rows, resource readings, one chart, one task area) with the self-hosted/no-hosted-account/no-public-demo caveat below it. On desktop viewports with motion allowed, the hero acts as a native scroll-driven pinned storytelling scene: the sticky stage remains pinned under the header while scrolling through the 200vh track, copy fades and drifts upward without lag, and the preview lifts into focus ~24px below the header with measured fit-scale centering to fit standard and shorter desktop heights (900/768/640) without clipping. Reversing scroll reverses the effect smoothly without time-based transition lag. Focus inside copy (`:focus-within`) restores full opacity and interaction, and pointer events are preserved during mid-fade. Mobile, viewports under 600px or unable to fit the console, and `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` safely render the plain stacked flow with zero extra scroll distance. On mobile, hero copy and CTAs precede the contained preview; do not scale a desktop console down.

Use capability groups, an audience and non-goals block, a four-part architecture and data-flow overview, a short startup workflow, deployment options with explicit demo/local explanation, native keyboard-operable FAQ disclosures, then deployment actions. The landing offers no dashboard entry and no public demo: primary CTAs link to the deployment docs and secondary CTAs to the GitHub repository. Dashboard access states must retain session authentication and non-sensitive errors. Preserve visible focus, a focusable skip target, sticky-header anchor clearance and reduced-motion support.

The Features section presents all six capabilities as sequential native sticky cards on fitting desktop viewports (at least 64rem wide and 40rem tall). Each card pins 24px beneath the header over a 40vh interval, with a shorter 20vh final interval, then releases naturally; reverse scrolling follows the same layout. Measure the enhanced card height before enabling the tracks. Mobile, short viewports, reduced motion, and panels too tall for the available viewport use the original static layout without extra scroll distance. Preserve every feature's text and inline links; never intercept wheel input.

## Reusable components

- `components/layout/FleetSidebar.tsx`: fleet navigation from VPS records and metric snapshots; `FleetHostItem.tsx`: route-aware selectable host row.
- `components/dashboard/shared/ResourceGauge.tsx`: labelled percentage, capacity/detail, segmented meter, unavailable state, and warning/critical thresholds.
- `components/dashboard/shared/SystemFacts.tsx`: responsive labelled facts strip from `{ label, value }` pairs.
- `components/dashboard/metrics/MetricsPanel.tsx` exports `ChartPanel`: shared telemetry history panel used by metrics and overview, with series legends, current readouts, and missing-history states.

Overview histories must match the selected VPS: CPU and memory render two percent series from that host's own `history` window, and network I/O renders separate RX/TX bytes-per-second series on a shared axis. RX/TX rows carry an explicit `networkUnit: "bytes/s"` stamp with `networkAvailable: false` on first/reset samples (projected to gaps, never zero); absent unit means unknown and renders `n/a` — never a guessed unit. Null gaps break chart lines without interpolation or zero-fill, and empty windows render `History unavailable` vs `Not enough history yet`. No fabricated network lines, no percent network threshold, and no relabelled CPU history.

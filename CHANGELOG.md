# Changelog

## Unreleased — Linux server icon

- Show a compact Linux penguin beside fleet card names when reported OS metadata identifies Linux; leave unknown and non-Linux systems unmarked.

## Unreleased — agent installer CLI smoke fix

- Move backend URL resolution into an undecorated shared module so the standalone agent installer can show `--help` from the repository root without loading NestJS services or requiring experimental decorator transforms. Preserve URL validation and API error behavior.

## Unreleased — compact VPS cards

- Keep fleet grid identity to server name, health and OS alongside live resource indicators and existing controls. Move connection, hardware, host ID, provider/location, tags, notes and runtime metadata to the individual VPS Overview's system details; table view and stored data are unchanged.

## Unreleased — agent backend URL cutover operations

- Document `flexserverctl set-backend <URL> [--mode auto|systemd|user] [--dry-run]` plus `flexserverctl validate-url <URL> [--updater]` and `flexserverctl help` in the README install section and `docs/local-agent-upgrade-operations.md` as the way to repoint an **existing** agent, with an explicit cross-reference that rerunning `install.sh --backend-url` (or the standalone installers) only sets the public setting and the default for newly written configs and deliberately leaves an already-installed config untouched rather than resetting its backend URL. No credential rotation is part of a URL change, so `--rotate` is never suggested for it. `--mode auto` is the default (systemd when root with a root-owned install, else user when `~/.vps-manager-agent` exists, otherwise a hint to pass `--mode`), while `--mode systemd|user` remain the only explicit forms; systemd rewrites `backendUrl` and `apiBase` only when the updater config exists, user rewrites `~/.vps-manager-agent/config.json` only; reading root-owned configs may need `sudo`; `--dry-run` is the only safe preview (no write, no stop, no start, no backup file; `dry-run: no changes applied`, exit 0) and `validate-url` has zero side effects.
- Document the migration URL policy: a migration target must be HTTPS and the updater `apiBase` stays `https`; validation is shape-only with no hostname allowlist or denylist, so DNS/TLS are settled by the health probe rather than a name check. Keep this distinct from the installers' URL allowance, which still accepts plain `http` for exact loopback (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`) for a fresh bootstrap install.
- Document the ordered transaction and verification: credential-free `GET <url>/api/health` (`User-Agent: flexserverctl/1.0`, system TLS verification, no redirect followed, bounded timeout/body and HTTP 200 + `{"ok": true}`) before any write; delivery preflight as `<agent> -config <cfg> -state <tempdir>/state.json -once -host-only`; same-URL apply still restarts the agent (and updater when installed) unit; updater in-flight guard requiring quiescent state (persisted settled helper record with phase `restarted` or `rolled_back` is permitted only when no daemon journal and no pending queue entries exist, while an active daemon run, pending entries, or corrupt/in-flight helper phase triggers refusal before mutation; updater daemon is stopped before the write and re-checked); on success the only on-disk artifact left behind is `.flexserverctl.bak`, which is deleted. Outcomes verbatim: `applied-with-heartbeat-confirmation-required`, `restored`, `rollback-failed`, `dry-run: no changes applied`; exit codes are `0` for success or a clean dry-run and `1` for any refusal, with pre-write refusals printing `Error: <reason>` to stderr and no `--yes`/`--force` override. A restart is liveness only — delivery is confirmed by a fresh parent-API heartbeat and updater proof is capped at `updater-process-observed`.
- Document rollback semantics: each touched config is restored from its `<config>.flexserverctl.bak` companion with the original bytes/owner/mode, the newly started loop is stopped, and the original loop is restarted with its preserved argv and cwd; backups are deleted only after a verified-successful restore and are retained deliberately on `rollback-failed` as operator recovery material. Endpoint or service recovery is not promised. Token preservation (never printed or rotated), config contents never logged, and rotation as a separate lossy bootstrap are documented alongside the installer CLI packaging surface (`/usr/local/bin/flexserverctl` by default, `--install-cli` default on, `--skip-cli`, `--cli-source`, `--cli-dest`, deliberately not removed by `--uninstall` since the CLI is shared tooling), the dashboard origin kept separate with deployment-dependent `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS`, and the canonical `AGENT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.
- Stable domain prerequisite documented: DNS must resolve, TLS must validate, and the reverse proxy must `proxy_pass` `/api/` (the cutover validation does not follow redirects). `api.flexserver.tech` DNS resolves and its HTTPS API origin is operational and verified, served through Nginx Proxy Manager with a managed certificate — it is an accepted backend URL once the health probe passes; `flexserver.tech` remains a working origin. Host cutover to `https://api.flexserver.tech` is verified (endpoint-only: `applied-with-heartbeat-confirmation-required` plus a fresh heartbeat); the canonical `AGENT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` GitHub repo Variable persistently holds `https://api.flexserver.tech`. This does not verify the binary-upgrade production gate. Existing agents are not automatically migrated, so repoint each one explicitly with `flexserverctl set-backend`. No new docs files, no code or test changes.

## Unreleased — English landing with no dashboard entry

- Rewrite the landing page fully in English with expanded coverage: capability groups, audience and non-goals, a web/API/storage/agent architecture and data-flow overview, startup workflow, deployment options with demo/local limits, pre-adoption FAQ, and deployment CTAs.
- Remove every landing link to the dashboard: primary CTAs point to the deployment docs and secondary CTAs to the GitHub repository. Auth, API, and dashboard routes are unchanged.
- Set the landing `lang` to English with English metadata, keep the black/lime identity and the labeled static sample preview, and preserve mobile navigation, sticky-header anchor offsets, and reduced-motion support.

## Unreleased — FlexTechnology branding

- Update the company name to FlexTechnology and the contact address to `contact@flexserver.tech` across the landing page and SEO metadata.
- Add a direct GitHub repository link to the landing footer and point landing documentation/issue links to the current ArseneLupin0111 repository.

## Unreleased — landing clarity and Vietnamese access

- Rework the charcoal/lime landing hero, readable static preview, five benefit groups, startup workflow, mode explanation, FAQ and deployment CTA.
- Correct the public-demo promise: `/vps` retains local password protection; simulated demo requires a demo-mode deployment. Link deployment actions to the existing README instructions.
- Localize dashboard access, loading and errors into Vietnamese, add a home link, and keep credentials/session behavior unchanged.
- Improve mobile preview typography, keyboard focus, anchor offsets and responsive layouts without new dependencies. Keep authentication regressions behavioral instead of pinning incidental copy.

## Unreleased — SaaS landing page

- Add a Vietnamese FlexServer landing page at `/` for Sondoan Technology, with a sample console, feature overview, deployment workflow, accessible FAQ and `contact@sondoan.dev` contact links.
- Keep `/vps` behind the existing local-mode authentication; do not fetch dashboard data or start monitoring on the public homepage.
- Add responsive desktop/mobile navigation, keyboard focus states, reduced-motion support and an authentication-boundary regression test.

## Unreleased — proxy address security patch

- Override and lock `proxy-addr` to 2.0.8 for Express consumers, fixing CVE-2026-90711 / GHSA-jqcg-44mw-7w3h (client-IP spoofing through short IPv4-mapped IPv6 trust prefixes).
- Keep the fixable-CRITICAL image security gate unchanged; the dependency patch replaces the vulnerable 2.0.7 package reported in the API image.

## Unreleased — Overview operational clarity

- Separate host health, recent job outcomes and container counts; show recent failed-job notices with a Jobs link, while treating non-running containers neutrally with a Docker link.
- Make Overview audit events readable without truncated identifiers or redundant server columns; retain full metadata in the details drawer.
- Increase secondary-text contrast and use explicit binary capacity units across host and Docker views; remove the duplicate Overview byte formatter.
- Show failed-job completion percentage, failure reason and finish time instead of an active progress bar; omit missing worker/duration metadata and replace the developer-facing network hint.
- Compact status cards, let recent jobs size to content, move static system facts below activity, and display the CPU model only once.

## Unreleased — scripts directory layout

- Group operational scripts into `agent/`, `vps/`, `admin/`, and `install/`; retain `ci/`, `release/`, and `tests/`.
- Update npm commands, CI filters, installer download URLs, relative imports, shell checks, and operator instructions to the new paths. npm command names and production `dist/scripts/` paths are unchanged.
- Restore the tracked executable bit on `scripts/install/install-updater.sh` after relocation so Linux bootstrap smoke checks and documented direct invocation do not fail with `Permission denied`.

## Unreleased — Recharts telemetry charts

- Replace custom SVG history charts for CPU/RAM, network RX/TX, and Docker CPU/memory with responsive Recharts components; resource meters remain unchanged.
- Add unit-aware hover and keyboard tooltips, numeric timestamp axes, and readable percentage/throughput/memory labels using the existing dark telemetry palette.
- Preserve missing samples as gaps and real zero values; retain empty/loading/error states, Docker coverage metadata, and single-sample indicators.

## Unreleased — compact agent status

- Reduce fleet cards to agent/access status, a short version, and one update badge; omit repeated labels, heartbeat text, commit hashes, and completed upgrade confirmations from compact card/table summaries.
- Keep active upgrade progress and recovery warnings visible; retain full build identity, heartbeat details, and upgrade history in workspace settings and confirmation dialogs.
## Unreleased — overview operational clarity

- Keep the breadcrumb header in document flow so it does not obscure overview cards when scrolling or capturing a full page; retain the sticky fleet sidebar.
- Label workspace health as host status, separate from job outcomes, and show an overview failure summary linking to the failed-jobs filter.
- Show recent job timestamps, available failure messages and log links, with explicit failed-at progress and a neutral zero-running badge.
- Reduce overview audit rows to Time, Event, Result, and Details while retaining the full audit filters and details drawer.

## Unreleased — Docker ingest replay recovery

- Use receive-time-independent ingest digests so retained agent batches can retry after a lost acknowledgment.
- Authenticate previously committed digest-v1 batches using their original ledger receipt time, identity, sequence, and committed watermark; changed bound payloads remain conflicts. No database migration or agent checkpoint reset is required.

## Unreleased — host metric charts

- Project bounded per-VPS CPU, memory, RX, and TX history into metrics, dashboard, and live monitoring responses.
- Standardize Go and local Linux network collectors on explicit bytes-per-second rates; mark first samples and counter resets unavailable rather than plotting false zero/spikes.
- Persist network units and availability in JSON and PostgreSQL (migration `022_metric_network_fields.sql`).
- Connect overview and metrics charts to timestamped same-host history, with separate RX/TX series, gap handling, and unit-aware readouts.
- Handle bounded SSE snapshots containing `refreshRequired` by reloading dashboard data over HTTP instead of dereferencing an absent overview and crashing after login.

## Unreleased — reference dashboard design

- Restyle FlexServer using the supplied VPS Management Dashboard reference: ink/lime palette, compact header, square panels, fleet cards/table, and workspace tabs.
- Align overview, metrics, Docker monitoring, jobs, audit, terminal, settings, forms, and overlays with shared design tokens while retaining API-backed controls and access restrictions.
- Keep missing telemetry explicit instead of presenting unrelated metric history as memory or network data.

## Unreleased — CI/CD optimization

- Scope PR checks through a lightweight change-detection job; keep the full verification matrix on main and honor manual force-build inputs.
- Run database integrations alongside verification, generate SBOMs only for publishable main runs, and avoid redundant standalone Node/Go builds.
- Transfer checksummed, verified Docker images to publish without rebuilding; verify loaded image identities and deploy the pushed digest references.
- Fix fail-fast migration asset smoke checks and grant change detection the pull-request read permission it requires.

## Unreleased — local agent upgrade

- Add signed, immutable agent/updater release manifests with pinned Ed25519 verification, a stable-channel catalog, build IDs, and compatibility checks.
- Add a separately installed, pull-only host updater with scoped credentials, a constrained privileged helper, durable journal, lease/fencing, signed-artifact verification, rollback, and backup retention when recovery is unverified.
- Add persistent local-upgrade jobs for JSON and PostgreSQL, admin confirmation and audit, idempotent outcomes, and fresh-heartbeat verification before success or verified rollback.
- Show installed build, release availability, updater health, manual instructions, confirmation, durable progress, and recovery guidance in local VPS card, table, and workspace views. Remote SSH upgrades remain separate.
- Harden installer signature gates, updater credential rotation, post-swap failure handling, filesystem boundaries, and confirmation-dialog focus restoration.

Production rollout is **not yet verified**. Complete the disposable Linux staging and fault-injection gate in `docs/local-agent-upgrade-operations.md`, publish a signed release matching the final commit, then perform an authorized production canary. API/web deployment alone does not replace the host agent.

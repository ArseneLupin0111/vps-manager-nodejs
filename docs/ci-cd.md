# CI/CD

This repository uses GitHub Actions for verification, Docker image publishing, and optional SSH deployment.

## Workflow

Workflow file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

### Pull requests

Pull requests run conditional verification behind a lightweight `changes` job (path filters, no toolchains installed): Node, Go, installer, updater, database, and image steps run only when their paths change, so a docs-only PR skips almost everything. Pushes to `main` force the full check matrix and both image builds. Pull requests do not publish images to GHCR and do not run the production deploy job.

Image filters intentionally include both Node workspaces: the current Dockerfile builds both in its shared build stage, so a web-only change still rebuilds both runtime images. Database integrations skip web-only changes; docs-only changes skip Node, Go, image, installer/updater, and database checks. Workflow and hardening-fixture changes re-run the affected safety checks.

Every pull request runs change detection, then only the matching checks:

1. When Node paths change: `npm ci`, `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, and the `--help` script smoke tests. `npm run build` runs only as a fallback when no Docker target builds (both image targets run the same build inside Docker).
2. When installer paths change: `bash scripts/tests/test-installer-docker-access.sh`.
3. When updater (or agent) paths change: pinned `Setup Go`, then `bash scripts/tests/test-updater.sh`.
4. `docker compose config --quiet` (always, cheap sanity gate).
5. When agent paths change: Go agent tested with the race detector plus `go vet` (the standalone `go build` was redundant — the API image build and the identity parity check both compile the agent).
6. When API/web paths change (or a workflow-dispatch force input selects them): Docker build checks for the affected runtime targets (`api-runtime`, `web-runtime`) with OCI labels.
7. When an API or web image is built: fail-fast smoke tests, the Docker-socket metadata guard, independent report-only Trivy scans, and the fail-closed CRITICAL gate. SBOM generation is main-only (SBOMs are release attestations; PRs are still scanned and gated).
8. When database paths change: TimescaleDB PostgreSQL migration integration (`postgres-integration`, `timescale/timescaledb:2.17.2-pg16`) runs concurrently with `verify` (no longer gated on it).
9. When database paths change: mandatory plain PostgreSQL 16 job (`docker-monitoring-postgres16`, `postgres:16`, `pg_isready` healthcheck, and `VPS_MANAGER_TEST_POSTGRES_URL`), separate from TimescaleDB; it runs the concrete migration, repository, and maintenance suites (`docker-migration-009/013/014.postgres.test.ts`, `docker-monitoring-repository.postgres.test.ts`, and `docker-monitoring-maintenance.postgres.test.ts`). `publish` requires both database jobs.

The PostgreSQL jobs run the same live-test contract against different server capabilities. Core migrations and Docker-monitoring tables must work on ordinary PostgreSQL; TimescaleDB is exercised separately for optional extension-aware deployments. Tests that require a live database are skipped when `VPS_MANAGER_TEST_POSTGRES_URL` is unset, but CI supplies it and therefore treats those cases as mandatory.

The `publish` job runs only on pushes to `main` (and equivalent non-PR workflow dispatches). It publishes the exact images built, scanned, and gated in `verify` — transferred as a checksummed `docker save` artifact with image-ID equality verification, never rebuilt. Pull requests never publish images or deploy.

### Pushes to `main`

Pushes to `main` force the full verification matrix (`full` scope: all checks and both image builds run regardless of path filters), then publish two Docker images to GHCR with the current commit SHA only (no `latest` tag for deployment):

- API:
  - `ghcr.io/sondoan17/vps-manager-nodejs-api:<commit-sha>`
- Web:
  - `ghcr.io/sondoan17/vps-manager-nodejs-web:<commit-sha>`

Transfer flow: `verify` saves both loaded images into one `docker save` archive (`verified-images-<sha>`, checksum + image-ID manifest, 1-day retention), and `publish` downloads it, verifies the checksum, loads it, asserts the image IDs match the scanned/saved images, then tags and pushes the SHA tags — build once, publish without rebuild. `publish` fails closed via an explicit `always()` needs check: every gate (`verify`, both database jobs) must report `success`. Because `main` forces all jobs to run, a skipped gate can never slip through.

Deploy pulls by immutable digest (`name@sha256:...` references recorded from `RepoDigests` after the push), not by SHA tag. Rollback stays reproducible by redeploying the image for an earlier commit SHA.

After publishing, the workflow can deploy over SSH if deployment secrets are configured.

Local systemd agent releases use the separate, reviewer-gated `.github/workflows/release-agent.yml` workflow. It signs an immutable manifest containing agent and updater Linux/amd64 artifacts, then advances the stable pointer. Publishing API/web images does not update the host agent. Configure `AGENT_RELEASE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `AGENT_RELEASE_MANIFEST_URL` together on the API; bootstrap the host updater with the same pinned key and a distinct local-updater credential. The private `AGENT_RELEASE_SIGNING_KEY` belongs only in the protected GitHub `release` environment. See `docs/local-agent-upgrade-operations.md` for staging checks, recovery, rotation, and rollback.

## Runtime topology

The production deployment runs three containers:

- `postgres`: TimescaleDB/PostgreSQL database on the internal Docker network; stores data in a Docker volume.
- `api`: NestJS API on internal port `3000`; stores data in Docker volumes.
- `web`: Nginx static web server on host port `3000`; proxies `/api/*` to `api:3000` and serves the SPA fallback.

The production docker-compose binds the web container to `127.0.0.1:3000` so it listens only on the loopback interface. An external HTTPS reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Cloudflare Tunnel) must terminate TLS and forward to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. The API health endpoint is reachable through the web proxy at `/api/health`.

## Required secrets for deployment

Set these in GitHub repository settings:

`Settings` → `Secrets and variables` → `Actions` → `Repository secrets`

| Secret                     | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `DASHBOARD_SESSION_SECRET` | Yes      | Secret for dashboard session token hashing. Required when `APP_MODE=local`.                                                                                                                       |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`        | Yes      | Password for the `vps_manager` PostgreSQL user. Used on first DB volume initialization and by the API `DATABASE_URL`.                                                                             |
| `DASHBOARD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | No       | Plaintext dashboard admin password. If set, the deploy step pipes it to `set-dashboard-password.js --stdin --skip-if-same` after migrations. If unset, the password must be set manually via SSH. |
| `VPS_KNOWN_HOSTS`          | No       | Pinned SSH known_hosts entry. If set, written directly to `known_hosts` instead of `ssh-keyscan` (TOFU). Recommended for production.                                                              |
| `VPS_PORT`                 | No       | SSH port. Defaults to `22`.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `DEPLOY_PATH`              | No       | Remote app directory. Defaults to `/opt/vps-manager-nodejs`.                                                                                                                                      |

If the required SSH secrets are missing, the deploy job exits successfully and prints a skip message.

Optional repository variables can override generated server `.env` values:

| Variable                        | Default   | Description                                                                                 |

### Configuring the agent release catalog in production

The deploy step writes `AGENT_RELEASE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `AGENT_RELEASE_MANIFEST_URL` into the server `.env` (mode `600`), and the generated compose file passes both to the `api` service explicitly. Configure them as repository **variables** (not secrets) and follow these rules:

- **Set them as a pair.** Both empty keeps the release catalog unavailable; setting only one makes the API refuse to start (fail closed). The public key must be base64 of exactly 32 raw Ed25519 bytes — the value printed by `node scripts/release/sign-manifest.mjs --print-pubkey` or read from the signature step of the published release run. The pointer URL must be `https` on an allowlisted host (see `RELEASE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `packages/api/src/release/release-config.ts`).
- **The public key and pointer URL are public by design.** They identify the trusted signer and the stable channel; they are not credentials, so repository variables are appropriate. Never put the private `AGENT_RELEASE_SIGNING_KEY` in a repository variable, the generated `.env`, or any compose file — it lives only in the protected GitHub `release` environment used by `release-agent.yml`.
- **To rotate the key**, publish the new public key to `AGENT_RELEASE_PUBLIC_KEY` and redeploy before signing any manifest with the replacement private key; see `docs/local-agent-upgrade-operations.md` for the staged rotation and rollback procedure.

## Server requirements

The target server needs:

- Docker
- Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose`)
- SSH access using the configured key
- Access to pull from `ghcr.io` during the deployment workflow

The workflow writes a production `.env` and `docker-compose.yml` into `DEPLOY_PATH`. Secrets from GitHub Actions are written to the server-side `.env` file with `chmod 600`; compose services load it with `env_file`.

Then the workflow runs:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d postgres
docker compose run --rm api node dist/db/migrate.js
# Optional and non-fatal:
docker compose run --rm api node dist/db/migrate.js --include-optional || true
docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
docker compose ps
```

After the first deploy (if `DASHBOARD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` was not set), set the dashboard admin password via SSH:

```bash
# Safer: read password from stdin without showing in process list
# (paste or pipe the password when prompted)
printf 'Dashboard password: ' > /dev/tty && read -rs password && printf '%s\n' "$password" | docker compose -f /opt/vps-manager-nodejs/docker-compose.yml run --rm api node dist/scripts/set-dashboard-password.js --stdin && unset password
```

Alternatively, set the `DASHBOARD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` GitHub Secret and redeploy — the CI workflow will bootstrap it automatically.

To rotate the password without downtime, pipe the new password with `--skip-if-same`:

```bash
printf 'New password: ' > /dev/tty && read -rs password && printf '%s\n' "$password" | docker compose -f /opt/vps-manager-nodejs/docker-compose.yml run --rm api node dist/scripts/set-dashboard-password.js --stdin --skip-if-same && unset password
```

The `--skip-if-same` flag avoids unnecessary session revocations when the password hasn't changed (e.g., re-running the deploy CI without changing the secret).

The database password is stored in the server-side `.env` file for this single-host deployment. To rotate it after the `vps-manager-postgres` volume exists, update the DB user password with `ALTER USER`, update the GitHub secret, then redeploy.

## Manual run

The workflow supports `workflow_dispatch`, so it can be run manually from the GitHub Actions tab. The `force_api_build` / `force_web_build` inputs only ever add an image build — leaving them unchecked (`false`) never forces anything; on a manual run from `main` the full matrix runs regardless of the force inputs.
